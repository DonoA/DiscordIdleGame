# Design Doc: Bit Economy and UI Enhancements

This document outlines a revision to the bit-earning mechanic and the addition of a user-facing help menu to improve clarity.

## 1. Revised Bit-Earning Mechanic

The current system of passive bit generation will be replaced with a more active, engaging model.

### Core Changes:
- **Bits from Messages:** Bits will now be generated exclusively when users send messages in text channels. Each message sent by a user will generate a base number of bits.

## 2. Voice Channel Message Multiplier

Voice channels will no longer be for user retention but will instead serve as a strategic multiplier for bit generation.

### Mechanic:
- **Message Rate Multiplier:** Users active in a voice channel will receive a multiplier to their message-sending rate. For example, a user in a voice channel might send messages at 2x or 3x their normal rate, thereby generating bits more quickly.
- **Strategic Depth:** This creates a strategic choice for the player: populate voice channels to boost overall message volume and bit income, at the cost of requiring more users to be active in those channels.

## 3. Help Menu Popup

To ensure players understand these new mechanics, a help menu will be added to the UI.

### UI Element:
- **Help Icon:** A small, non-intrusive help icon (e.g., a "?") will be placed in a corner of the main UI, likely near the bit counter or control panel.
- **Popup/Modal:** Clicking this icon will open a popup or modal window that displays a clear, concise explanation of how bits are generated.

### Content of the Help Menu:
The popup will contain the following information:

**How to Earn Bits**

- **Text Channels:** Users earn bits by sending messages in text channels. The more messages sent, the more bits you earn.
- **Voice Channels:** Each voice channel increases now quickly users send messages.
- **Upgrades:** Invest in server and channel upgrades to increase the number of bits earned per message.
