1. All bits come from posts, users die off over time though
2. Voice channels retain users over time
3. Server leveling
4. Moderators maybe reduce users leaving
5. Special events attract users but add bad users to the pool
6. Bad user mechanic (trolls)
7. Higher level channels for more bits
8. Meta progression would be updates to discord itself or maybe server leveling which unlocks new discord features like live streaming
