# Expanded Game Mechanics

This document expands on the initial ideas listed in `AddedGameMechanics.md`.

## 1. Bit Generation and User Lifecycles

*   **Bits from Posts:** All bits, the primary in-game currency, are generated from user posts in text channels. The more active a channel, the more bits it generates.
*   **User Attrition:** Users have a natural lifecycle and will eventually leave the server. This creates a constant need to attract new users to maintain a healthy bit economy. The base user lifespan will be a random value within a certain range, but can be influenced by other factors.

## 2. Voice Channels and User Retention

*   **User Retention:** Voice channels will play a key role in retaining users. Users who join a voice channel will have their "leave timer" paused, and perhaps even slightly reversed, making them stay on the server longer.
*   **Active vs. Idle:** While in a voice channel, users do not generate bits, creating a trade-off between user retention and bit generation.

## 3. Server Leveling

*   **Experience Points:** Servers will gain experience points (XP) from various activities, such as user posts, users joining, and reaching certain milestones.
*   **Leveling Up:** Once a server accumulates enough XP, it will level up.
*   **Unlocks:** Leveling up a server will unlock new features, perks, and bonuses. Examples include:
    *   Increased bit generation rates.
    *   Higher user capacity.
    *   New channel types (e.g., streaming channels).
    *   Access to moderator tools.

## 4. Moderators and Server Health

*   **Reducing Attrition:** Moderators will be a special user type that can be "assigned" to a server. Their presence will reduce the rate at which users leave the server.
*   **Cost:** Hiring and maintaining moderators will have a bit cost, creating another strategic decision for the player.

## 5. Special Events

*   **Attraction:** Special events can be triggered to attract a large influx of new users to the server.
*   **Risk vs. Reward:** These events, while beneficial for population growth, also carry the risk of introducing "bad users" (trolls) into the user pool.

## 6. Bad User Mechanic (Trolls)

*   **Negative Impact:** Trolls are a special type of user that negatively impacts the server. They can:
    *   Reduce bit generation in the channels they occupy.
    *   Increase the rate at which other users leave.
    *   Potentially "infect" other users, turning them into trolls.
*   **Moderator Interaction:** Moderators will have the ability to identify and "ban" trolls, removing them from the server.

## 7. Channel Leveling and Bit Generation

*   **Channel Experience:** Individual channels can also gain experience and level up, similar to servers.
*   **Increased Bits:** Higher-level channels will generate more bits per user post. This creates an incentive for players to focus on developing specific channels.

## 8. Meta Progression

*   **Discord Updates:** Meta progression will be represented by updates to the "Discord client" itself. These updates can be purchased with a large number of bits or unlocked through server-level milestones.
*   **New Features:** These updates will unlock significant new features, such as:
    *   Live streaming capabilities in voice channels.
    *   Server boosting mechanics.
    *   Advanced moderator bots.
